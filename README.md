## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed and configured:

- **AWS CLI**: Configured with appropriate permissions to manage AWS resources.
- **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher.
- **jq**: Required for environment variable generation.

### Step 1: Set Up the Backend

**Important**: The backend must be set up first. Follow the instructions in the [e-banking-backend repository](https://github.com/Nahiyan-16/e-banking-backend).

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/e-banking-app.git
cd e-banking-app
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Step 4: Generate Environment Variables

1. Navigate to the `scripts` folder.
2. Set your AWS region in the `env-generator.sh` file.
3. Run the script to generate `.env.production` and `aws-exports.js` for AWS Cognito:

```sh
cd scripts
chmod +x env-generator.sh
./env-generator.sh
```

---

## 🖥️ Option 1: Run Frontend Locally

### 1. Set Up Local Environment Variables

Create a `.env.development` file:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/user
```

Add to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive data:

```gitignore
# .gitignore
.env*
```

### 2. Start the Frontend

```sh
npm start
```

### 3. Run the Backend

Follow the instructions in the [e-banking-backend repository](https://github.com/Nahiyan-16/e-banking-backend) to start the backend:

```sh
node server.mjs
```

### 4. Access the Application

The application is now fully functional locally.

---

## ☁️ Option 2: Deploy Frontend to AWS S3

### 1. Build the Frontend

```sh
npm run build
```

### 2. Ensure Backend is Running

Verify that the backend is deployed and operational as per the [e-banking-backend repository](https://github.com/Nahiyan-16/e-banking-backend).

### 3. Deploy to S3

1. Navigate to the `scripts` folder.
2. Run the deployment script:

```sh
cd scripts
chmod +x deploy-frontend.sh
./deploy-frontend.sh
```

### 4. Access the Hosted Application

After deployment, the CLI will provide a URL to access the hosted website.

---

## Teardown the frontend

```sh
cd scripts
chmod +x teardown-frontend.sh
./teardown-frontend.sh
```
